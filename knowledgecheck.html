I went to take pictures of my photography assignment. I'm really proud such site of attraction  was dedicated to Gani Fawehinmi. <br>
He was a man of honor and justice</p> <br>
The park had beautiful sceneries thought it needs more security because of the Ojota oppotunists. It requires maintenance too. But overall I loved it <br> <p>
